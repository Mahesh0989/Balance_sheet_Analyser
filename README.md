# Balance_sheet_Analyser
A clean and scalable web app to evaluate companies financial statements, helping users make informed investment decisions.


The Balance Sheet Analyzer is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload and analyze a company's balance sheet in CSV format. It calculates key financial ratios, evaluates performance, and assesses the risk profile of the company based on the uploaded data.

This project was developed as a practical financial tool and as a demonstration of my ability to build complete applications from frontend to backend with real-world relevance.



## Features
• Upload CSV files containing balance sheet data
• Automatically extract and process financial information
• Calculate financial ratios such as current ratio and debt-to-equity
• Rate the company’s performance as Good, Average, or Poor
• Evaluate risk level as Low, Medium, or High
• Store uploaded data securely using a PostgreSQL database
• Simple and responsive frontend interface
• REST API for financial logic and communication
